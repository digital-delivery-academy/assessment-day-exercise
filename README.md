## Coding Exercise

We have a coffee shop; Hell or Glory (HoG). We currently only sell our coffee in our retail store. In store, customers can either buy a coffee we make for them, or they can buy our coffee beans to take home with them and enjoy themselves. For our beans, we sell a variety of different grinds to work with different machines.

We’ve set up everything from interior design (Swedish inspired) to personally selecting the coffee roasters myself. We’ve kind of neglected the IT side of things, so much so, our till transactions and what coffee we serve are stored in simple flat (CSV) files.

We’ve attached the takings for yesterday and the coffee prices.

We need a simple test harness, ideally using a unit testing framework of your choice to tell me stuff about the files.

Our requirements are expressed as User Stories below.
